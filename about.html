        <p><b>Information Problem to be Solved</b></p> 
        <p>Our goal for this project was to take available Prince George's County Budgetary data, 
          and display it in a way that is more easily understandable. Prince George's county provides yearly budgetary data, 
          and each available dataset contains thousands of entries. With this project,
           we hope to gain an understanding of which companies/industires budget is allocated to.</p> 
        <br>

        <p><b>Identified Stakeholders/Target Browsers</b></p>

            <li>• Government spending auditors and researchers</li>

        <p><b>Data Source</b></p>
        <p>https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/browse?category=Finance+and+Budget</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Chosen Strategies</b></p> 
        <ul>For this project, we were given yearly data available from Prince George's County that was divided into these points:</p>
          <li>• Payee Name</li>
          <li>• Agency</li>
          <li>• Zip Code</li>
          <li>• Amount</li>
          <li>• Payment Description</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Given the available data, we decided to break this down by the Agency. 
        
        The Agency is the direct recipient of the goals of the PG County budget. It also tells us information as 
        to which sector of the economy the budget is being targeted at. For example, one agency is Rustler Construction INC,
         a Maryland local construction contractor. The data provided has thousands of entries, with numerous different agencies. 
         To make the chart more readable while maintaing impact, we decided to create an interval system, so we can inspect specific entries carefully.
        
        Originally we wanted to add a geospatial element to this project, where we would be able to see which areas specific portions 
        of the funding were spent. We determined this to be too much for this project, and decided to drop this element prior to the due date. 
      </p>

      <p><b>Technical Decisions + Technology Stack</b></p>
          <ul><b>Frameworks</b>
              <li>• Bulma/Font-Awesome</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <ul><b>Libraries</b>
              <li>• Canvas.js</li>
              <li>• D3</li>
          </ul>
        
        
        <br>

        <p><b>Reasoning</b></p>
        <p>
        <b>• Bulma</b>: Bulma is an open source CSS Framework based on Flexbox. Bulma gave us an easy and powerful 
        customization tool to make our website look modern, while maintaining performance. Bulma is unique in that it is 
        all written within one single file, which makes it a portable and compatible choice. Within our index.html file, we 
        simply import it as a stylesheet. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>• Canvas.js</b> was chosen for its ability to neatly generate, manipulate, and design dynamic graphs. 
            Canvas was used for generating our primary bar graph for this project. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>• D3</b> is a manipulation engine for CVS files. Since the data provided by Prince George's County is supplied in a .cvs file format, we needed this tool to properly ingest and manipulate the data before utilizing it in Canvas.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p><b>Addressing the Problem</b></p>
        <p>Our website provides a summarization of the largest 10 Agencies to receive funding from the Prince George's County budget.
           This provides us insight as to what various industries and sections of our society are receiveing funding. For example, 
           for all 5 years of the dataset available to us, the Prince Georgies County Board has taken 4 billion of the total funding. 
           In comparison, the 4th most well funded agency is Connex Transit, at 127 Million. Here we see a stark disparity in where 
           the budget is going, and our solution allowed us to have this perspective. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Challenges Faced</b></p>
        <p>
        During the creation of this project, we encountered a few challenges along the way. The first challenge we encountered was handling the 
        large amount of data we have been given to work with. We needed to find a way to properly work with this data, and parse it smartly. 
        To do this we utilized D3 to help with parsing the dataset.
        
        A portion that presented a challenge was properly linking event listeners to multiplte check boxes, as well as linking filters 
        to the event listeners. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul><b>Future Work Directions</b></p>
        <li>• Add a geospatial element to allow localized dispurtion of funding</li>
        <li>• Add various graphing options for more varied options to analyze the dataset</li>
      </ul>
